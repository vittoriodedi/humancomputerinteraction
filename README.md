# humancomputerinteraction

This repository contains my final project and related materials from the *Human Computer Interaction* course.

## Overview

The repository includes multiple files created throughout the course, each focusing on different aspects of user interface design and evaluation, developed in collaboration with both the Italian and English course instructors.

## Contents

* 📄 **`Interfaccia HCI Vittorio Dedi.pdf`**
  This is the main project developed using Figma. The objective was to design a **vector-based infotainment display interface for a car**, applying all theoretical principles learned in the course.
  The process started with the definition of a **user persona**, outlining their needs and expectations. Based on this profile, the interface was gradually built and refined, reflecting usability principles and interaction design best practices. This part of the project was conducted with the **Italian professor**.

* 📄 **`User Persona.pdf`**
  This document presents the detailed **user persona** used as the foundation for the design in the main interface project.

* 📄 **`Fixing_Improving HCI Group A.pdf`**
  Developed during sessions with the **English professor**, this document involved **Group A** (my group) reviewing the professor's application. We identified elements that could be improved to enhance the overall user experience, providing actionable feedback and suggestions based on usability heuristics.

* 📄 **`HCI Survey Group A.pdf`**
  Also created under the guidance of the **English professor**, this document contains the results of a **user survey** we conducted at the university. The survey focused on evaluating the usability and effectiveness of the application (specifically, one of our own projects, mine in this case) based on real user feedback.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a comprehensive archive of my work for the *Human Computer Interaction* course, covering both **design** and **evaluation** practices.
